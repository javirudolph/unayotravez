```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
```

This is one of the things I keep doing over and over again, but the code just will not stay in my head! Perhaps there is a package already out there, but if there is, I never found it.  

**How to make many many density lines or curves in the same plot?**  

My work with seed dispersal led me here. I needed to simulate thousands of dispersal kernels, and then I wanted to see them. These kernels where generated by following a density function, but their parameters where different. As an example, you can look at [Figure 5](https://javirudolph.github.io/aracari/Ch1_movement_rates/Ch1_Figures.html) in my dissertation's first chapter.  

So, how do we do this?


To start, let's say you want to plot the density of a normal distribution: 
```{r}

```
